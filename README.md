```lrc
[00:00.13] Put on your belt, it's a bumpy road
[00:02.06] But I'm feelin' like Bumpy Johnson
[00:06.58] Good, die young, I'm a wrongen
[00:10.12] Long live Driss, he's never forgotten (You're now listening to Young Chencs)
[00:13.31] If my man cross me, then, I'm cuttin' his fingers off, so fingers crossed
[00:16.30] My fingerprints all over the rocks
[00:17.91] It's hot, no other choice but to rinse the spot
[00:19.87] I'm selective with who I get with
[00:21.48] Gyal on my phone try see who I'm fuckin'
[00:23.20] Lil' bro got his hand in his pocket
[00:24.72] Come any closer and see if he's bluffin'
[00:26.55] Six-man in the yard, O.T. was the last to sleep and I woke up first
[00:29.93] Bad Bs, they curved the kid back then when I weren't so lit, now the roles reversed
[00:33.59] Soon as you get some Ps, these hoes occur, hoes appear
[00:36.76] Nowhere near, had nowhere to live, had to sofa surf (uh)
[00:39.69] At the time, it was bad, it was all in my mind
[00:41.71] 'Cause in hindsight, it could've been worse
[00:43.54] Ex ting givin' me red eye and spoilin' my new one, it could've been her
[00:46.58] "Don't dwell on the past," I'm tellin' my darg, "If it happened, then bro, there's a reason"
[00:49.92] I ain't beefin' bro 'bout nothin', we act like men and we come to agreements
[00:53.35] The cell got hit, but I bit too late, so I gave him one for the inconvenience
[00:56.73] Rookie, young but I ain't no rookie, your place got took 'cause you're inexperienced
[01:00.15] I don't think that them man there serious
[01:01.81] In the trap, had a plan like that
[01:03.14] Same way man pull up my pants and take off my hat and change my 'ppearance
[01:06.92] A lot of pain I'm used to endurin', I see man screw and I'm throwin' my Ls up
[01:10.51] Dagger on bro like Zelda, ain't Nintendo, this is the ghetto
[01:13.28] We trap like The Wire, they act like Elba
[01:15.15] Don't have a Scooby, I stay with dookie
[01:16.70] I got my darg, it's somethin' like Shaggy
[01:18.27] I got a good girl like Velma
[01:20.37] Was young, goin' school to let out the anger I had that was built inside
[01:23.62] You get a weird mix of emotion when you feel both guilt and pride
[01:26.89] Long day and I need upliftin', switch up the sound to a feel-good vibe
[01:30.18] These songs are all self-snitchin', if I did do a drill, I'd deny it
[01:33.20] Tryna dodge old bro, bake off in the bando, hold my nose, it's a horrid smell
[01:36.83] Ba-bad one comin' from qway, so, I'm travellin' West from Tottenham Hale
[01:40.33] Some man think that 'cause they met man once they know me well
[01:43.16] Man, I've done what I've done in the ends
[01:44.49] But nobody's done what I've done on a global scale
[01:46.73] Young and fresh, they ain't no threat, they're old and frail (haha)
[01:49.97] Pop down brehs just dropped my name in a song and they hope it sells (huh)
[01:54.27] Sit back and watch them embarrass themselves
[01:56.42] Made a French connection, see mans blueprint workin', now they go Paris as well
[02:00.19] Put on your belt, it's a bumpy road
[02:01.88] But I'm feelin' like Bumpy Johnson
[02:03.61] One call and my bro get the job done
[02:05.11] Fuck everyone, I ain't feelin' monogamous
[02:06.72] Stayin' anonymous isn't a problem
[02:08.32] Good, die young, I'm a wrongen
[02:09.91] Long live Driss, he's never forgotten
[02:11.65] A real trap boy stay juggin'
[02:13.33] Put on your belt, it's a bumpy road
[02:15.22] But I'm feelin' like Bumpy Johnson
[02:16.97] One call and my bro get the job done
[02:18.51] Fuck everyone, I ain't feelin' monogamous
[02:20.13] Stayin' anonymous isn't a problem
[02:21.71] Good, die young, I'm a wrongen
[02:23.44] Long live Driss, he's never forgotten
[02:25.00] A real trap boy stay juggin'
